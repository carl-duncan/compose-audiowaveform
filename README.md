## Description
AudioWaveform is a lightweight Jetpack Compose library which draws waveform of audio.   
Library uses compose `Canvas API` under the hood. It helps us to create customizable and flexible waveforms. 
This library was inspired by the [WaveformSeekBar](https://github.com/massoudss/waveformSeekBar) library (`xml` implementation).   
AudioWaveform is fully compatible with [Amplituda](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda) library.
