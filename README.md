## Description
AudioWaveform is a lightweight Jetpack Compose library which draws waveform of audio.   
Library uses compose `Canvas API` under the hood. It helps us to create customizable and flexible waveforms. 
This library was inspired by the [WaveformSeekBar](https://github.com/massoudss/waveformSeekBar) library (`xml` implementation).   
AudioWaveform is fully compatible with [Amplituda](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda) library.

## Download
``` groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```
``` groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.lincollincol:compose-audiowaveform:x.y.z'
}
```

## Usage
#### Common way
``` kotlin
var waveformProgress by remember { mutableStateOf(0F) }
AudioWaveform(
  amplitudes = amplitudes,
  progress = waveformProgress,
  onProgressChange = { waveformProgress = it }
)
``` 

#### Custom color
* `SolidColor()` - single color `Brush`.
* `Brush.horizontalGradient()`, `Brush.verticalGradient()` (and more) - default `Brush` static gradient implementations.
* `Brush.infinite*Gradient()` (where * is one of `linear`, `horizontal` or `vertical`)  - infinite animated gradient. This is AudioWaveform library extension functions created with [this article](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/animating-brush-text-coloring-in-compose-%EF%B8%8F-26ae99d9b402).
``` kotlin
var waveformProgress by remember { mutableStateOf(0F) }

val colorBrush = SolidColor(Color.Magenta)

val staticGradientBrush = Brush.linearGradient(colors = listOf(Color(0xff22c1c3), Color(0xfffdbb2d)))

val animatedGradientBrush = Brush.infiniteLinearGradient(
  colors = listOf(Color(0xff22c1c3), Color(0xfffdbb2d)),
  animation = tween(durationMillis = 6000, easing = LinearEasing),
  width = 128F
)

AudioWaveform(
  progress = waveformProgress,
  progressBrush = brush,
  amplitudes = amplitudes,
  onProgressChange = { waveformProgress = it }
)
``` 

#### All parameters
``` kotlin
var waveformProgress by remember { mutableStateOf(0F) }
AudioWaveform(
  modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
  // Spike DrawStyle: Fill or Stroke 
  style = Fill,
  waveformAlignment = WaveformAlignment.Center, 
  amplitudeType = AmplitudeType.Avg,
  // Colors could be updated with Brush API
  progressBrush = SolidColor(Color.Magenta),
  waveformBrush = SolidColor(Color.LightGray),
  spikeWidth = 4.dp,
  spikePadding = 2.dp,
  spikeRadius = 4.dp,
  progress = waveformProgress,
  amplitudes = amplitudes,
  onProgressChange = { waveformProgress = it },
  onProgressChangeFinished = {}
)
```

## Sample app
You could also try [sample app](https://github.com/lincollincol/compose-audiowaveform/tree/develop/app), which demonstrates all AudioWaveform library features. 
Waveform from sample app is also synchronized with [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3).
Download sample app apk [here](https://github.com/lincollincol/compose-audiowaveform/blob/develop/readme/audiowaveform_sample.apk)

## Amplituda compatibility
AudioWaveform requires `amplitudes` to draw waveform. This parameter is a list of integers, which represents audio data.
You can process the audio file by yourself or use already existing library [Amplituda](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda).  
[Amplituda](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda) is a fast audio processing library, which provides you data for drawing waveforms.
Library has [caching](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda#-cache-output-data) and [compressing](https://github.com/lincollincol/Amplituda#-compress-output-data) processed data features out of the box.
Here is [Amplituda library usage](https://github.com/lincollincol/compose-audiowaveform/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/linc/audiowaveform/sample/data/AudioManager.kt) in a sample app
